//! The scaffolding the gate's integration suites share.
//!
//! It lives once because `scratch` existed three times and `instruction` twice,
//! already disagreeing on their directory prefixes, which is how a fixture fix
//! lands in one copy and a later suite inherits the stale-socket flake the
//! pre-clean exists to prevent.
//!
//! **This is the gate's own copy, and a fourth copy of `weaver-spu`'s
//! `tests/common` is not what it is.** The two crates duplicate
//! `seqpacket_pair`, a bounded wait, and a descriptor placement, and sharing
//! those across crates means a dev-only support crate, which is an eighth
//! member of a set the corpus fixes at seven and a change the graph would see.
//! That is a decision for the seats rather than a patch, and it is named in the
//! PR that carries this file.
