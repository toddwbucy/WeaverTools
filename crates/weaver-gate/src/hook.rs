//! The instruction's resolution, the bind, and the predicate, per
//! `weaver-gate-Spec` section 3.
//!
//! **The instruction is resolved, never interpreted beyond its fields.** This
//! crate consumes exactly two things from it: the socket path to bind and the
//! access rule the predicate judges against.
//!
//! **This module exposes the crate's one bind site**, [`Hook::raise`], which
//! takes the instruction. A listener built anywhere else in this crate is out
//! of bounds, and the two named shapes are pinned here because an absence is
//! what a runtime test structurally cannot demonstrate.
//!
//! **The pins name the real site and fail on its type**, which is what makes
//! them mean anything. An earlier cut called a `Hook::bind` that never existed,
//! so both pins failed to compile on the missing name and would have gone on
//! passing if a path-taking constructor had been added beside it. These fail
//! because a path is not an instruction, and the day `raise` grows a path-
//! taking overload or a generic bound that admits one, they compile and fire:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn pin(path: &str) -> weaver_gate::hook::Hook {
//!     // A bare string is not an instruction.
//!     weaver_gate::hook::Hook::raise(path).unwrap()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn pin(path: std::path::PathBuf) -> weaver_gate::hook::Hook {
//!     // Nor is a PathBuf outside the instruction.
//!     weaver_gate::hook::Hook::raise(&path).unwrap()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A compile-fail pin passes on any compile error, so this one compiles and
//! names the site and its accessor, failing loudly the day either is renamed
//! away and leaving the two above with nothing to fail against:
//!
//! ```
//! fn reads(hook: &weaver_gate::hook::Hook) -> &std::path::Path {
//!     hook.bound_path()
//! }
