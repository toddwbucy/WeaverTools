//! conforms: trace-kind-payload-mapping-total
//!
//! **The kind set's count, read by the compiler rather than by a reader.**
//! `weaver-trace-Spec` section 3 states the mapping is total over twenty-one
//! kinds and sixteen dispositions, and records that the recount has gone wrong
//! twice, the second time silently, both halves standing at eighteen kinds
//! against a crate compiling thirteen. Until this file the count stood in prose
//! and in no instrument, and a mapping that is stale reads exactly like a
//! mapping that is total.
//!
//! **What this reaches is the kind set and not the mapping.** The array's
//! declared length fixes the number, and `ordinal`'s match, exhaustive and
//! wildcard-free, is what a kind added to the enum has to be written into.
//! The array is written out rather than derived, so the two assertions below
//! are what close the distance between the two.
//!
//! **What a grown kind set stops on here is `ordinal`, and nothing else.** An
//! act that adds a kind and answers the lib's own matches stops at this file,
//! whose match no longer covers the enum. **An act that also writes the new
//! arm here and leaves `ALL` alone passes**, whatever that arm returns, both
//! assertions walking `ALL` and so never reaching a kind the array does not
//! name. The number can still drift by one act. Closing that wants the array
//! written against the match rather than beside it, which is a representation
//! election and issue #633's rather than this file's.
//!
//! Neither the disposition count nor the mapping's totality is reached, both
//! being properties of `pairing_licensed`, which is crate-private and which
//! this file cannot see from outside the crate. **That is this act's placement
//! and not a property of the crate**: `writer.rs` carries no test module today
//! and a unit test there would see the function and reach all three claims. The
//! cited record keeps its tag because this file reaches one of the three, and
//! the split that would let the tag move is issue #633 rather than an
//! assumption left in prose.
