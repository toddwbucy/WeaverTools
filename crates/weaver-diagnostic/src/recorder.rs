//! section 5. The surface mirrors `weaver-trace`'s receive and submit and
//! shares no type with it: the shape is what lets the harness hold the two
//! recorders under one form with the binding's kind selecting the arm, and
//! sharing no type is what keeps the mirror from becoming a dependency.
//!
//! **Where the sibling queues, this writer is synchronous, and the
//! difference is the working structure's absence.** The serving recorder
//! holds a RAM copy of the run and a background writer behind a queue; this
//! crate holds neither, per the contract's section 2 - a replay's present is
//! the holdings `weaver-state` serves, so a second copy here would hold by
//! one road what the loop already holds by another. With nothing to hold,
//! there is nothing to queue against, and the write happens in the submit:
//! admission first, the sequence assigned, the line rendered once, the bytes
//! on the sink before the call returns.
