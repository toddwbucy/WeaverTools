//! Sampling and the dispositions, per `weaver-spu-Spec` section 8.
//!
//! **Every knob carries a [`Disposition`], elected at the worker's composition
//! root.** A knob is `Frozen` with its value compiled into the binary, or
//! `OperatorTunable` and routed from the agent's configuration at load. The
//! machinery beneath takes a plain value and never learns which side supplied
//! it, which is what makes the two dispositions cost the same and a change
//! between them one line and a recompile.
//!
//! **A knob left without an election does not compile.** The type carries no
//! third case and no default, so a bare value where a disposition belongs is a
//! type error rather than a silent choice:
//!
//! Perturbation for the first pin: change a field to its bare type, as in
//! `pub temperature: f32`, and this stops failing, because a value with no
//! election then means something. Watched under exactly that change. A `From`
//! impl does not defeat it, since a struct field takes no implicit conversion,
//! which is why the field's own type is what carries the compulsion.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use weaver_spu::sampling::{Disposition, Knobs};
//! // A value with no election. There is no `From<f32>` and no `Default`, so
//! // this cannot mean anything and does not compile.
//! let knobs = Knobs {
//!     temperature: 0.7,
//!     top_k: Disposition::OperatorTunable,
//!     top_p: Disposition::OperatorTunable,
//!     repetition_penalty: Disposition::OperatorTunable,
//!     repetition_window: Disposition::OperatorTunable,
//!     seed: Disposition::OperatorTunable,
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use weaver_spu::sampling::Knobs;
//! // Nor is there a default to fall back on.
//! let knobs = Knobs::default();
//! ```
//!
//! Perturbation for the second pin: derive `Default` on [`Knobs`] and on
//! [`Disposition`], which needs a third case to default to, and this stops
//! failing. Watched under exactly that change, and the third case it forces is
//! the point: a default knob set cannot be built without inventing the
//! unelected state the type refuses to carry.
//!
//! **The knob set is a struct literal a doctest reads, and the seed is among
//! it.** Every member rides its own disposition, so a knob added or dropped
//! stops the build rather than being noticed later. Perturbation: drop the
//! `seed` field and this doctest fails on the missing initializer, which is the
//! membership check working. Watched under exactly that removal. The seed is a
//! knob for the
//! first time in this code's lineage: the archived tree carried it as a
//! hardcoded default and a determinism test and never made it configurable, and
//! a frozen seed beside a frozen sampling surface is what makes a binary's
//! declared starting field re-enterable, per apex section 8.
