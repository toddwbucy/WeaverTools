//! The mistral3 family, per `weaver-spu-Spec` section 5.
//!
//! Everything mistral3 defines sits here: its instruction markers, the
//! rendering that uses them, the preamble its prefix opens with, the parse of
//! its own emissions, and its stop conditions. The scanning beneath is
//! [`super::scan`], shared and marker-free.
//!
//! **This is the first family that names no role at all.** Every other carried
//! family writes the speaker into the turn, as `<|im_start|>user` or
//! `<|turn>model`. Mistral wraps the user's text in `[INST]` and `[/INST]` and
//! leaves the model's text bare, so the role is carried by the shape rather
//! than by a word. There is nothing for a `{role}` placeholder to substitute,
//! which is why this module renders each turn directly instead of driving
//! [`super::render_template`].
//!
//! **Its generation opener is empty, and that is the whole point of the
//! family.** `[/INST]` is emitted by the *user's* turn and is already the
//! assistant's turn opened and left unfinished, so there is nothing to append
//! after a delta. Every other family's opener exists because its user turn
//! closes without electing the next speaker; this one's does elect it.
//!
//! **The prefix opens with `<s>`, for a reason worth reading twice.** The
//! artifact declares `add_bos_token: true`, so its own tooling expects the
//! tokenizer to add the BOS and the template emits `bos_token` besides.
//! [`crate::residency::Resident::tokenize`] calls `str_to_token` with
//! `AddBos::Never`, so nothing downstream adds one here and the renderer must.
//! **[`gemma4`](super::gemma4) needs the same preamble and arrives at it from
//! the opposite declaration**, `add_bos_token: false` with the template
//! emitting it. Two families, two conventions, one joint.
//!
//! Measured against `Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512-Q4_K_M.gguf`, whose
//! header declares `general.architecture = mistral3`, on 2026-08-17.
//! **Most Mistral artifacts do not declare this architecture.** Mistral-Small
//! 3.1, Mistral-Small 3.2 and Magistral-Small all report `llama`, which is the
//! census fact behind #88: the header names an architecture and an
//! architecture does not determine a template.
