//! conforms: spu-device-authority-is-the-driver
//!
//! The device queries the admission judgment reads, per `weaver-spu-Spec`
//! section 3.
//!
//! **The device judgment reads the driver rather than this crate's own
//! accounting.** Charter section 10 held the question open with the archived
//! tree's answer recorded as a preference without a reason: that tree held its
//! own allocation ledger as the authority and marked the driver query as
//! diagnostics only, which prefers the number that cannot see the thing the
//! check exists for. This crate holds no fleet ledger to prefer, and the case
//! it exists to catch is a device occupied by something this program did not
//! put there, so the authority is what the device reports free at the moment of
//! admission.
//!
//! **The cost is named rather than hidden:** the queries below run on the admit
//! path, which happens twice per residency and never inside a turn.
//!
//! This module compiles only under the `cuda` feature. The no-feature build
//! reaches none of it, which is what keeps the family surface testable on a
//! machine with no device.
