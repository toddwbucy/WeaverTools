//!
//! Residual readout, per `weaver-spu-Spec` section 7.
//!
//! **The reduction happens at the tap, before anything leaves the device.**
//! Apex section 3 step 6 has the activations reduced in place and the reduction
//! returning by the same path as the generation, so no per-layer tensor crosses
//! the seam and the volume the seam carries is the reduction's. That is stated
//! here as a type rather than as a discipline: [`Tap::observe`] is handed a
//! layer's activations by reference and answers nothing, accumulating into the
//! reduction it owns, and the only thing that leaves is [`Reduction`]. There is
//! no path on this seam that returns a per-layer tensor, so a caller cannot
//! carry one off the device by mistake.
//!
//! **One shape, whichever backend produced it.** The native path uses the
//! candle fork's `forward_with_intermediates` and the GGUF path the ggml
//! scheduler's eval callback the llama-cpp fork exposes. Both drive this seam
//! and both answer [`Reduction`], so a consumer reads one shape and cannot tell
//! which engine produced it. **The native tap stands as of 2026-08-19** for
//! the families whose declarations say so, at both widths, folding each
//! layer's device-side norm through [`Reduction::fold_norm`]. **The GGUF tap
//! stands as of 2026-08-22**, in [`crate::decoder::gguf_tap`], reading
//! `l_out-<il>` off the ggml scheduler's eval callback and folding through
//! [`Reduction::fold`]. Both answer [`Reduction`], so [`judge`] now reads
//! the family's flag alone: the container stopped being a ground for
//! refusing on the day the second tap stood.
//!
//! **What the GGUF tap has shown and what it still owes.** `weaver-spu-PRD`
//! section 13.7 obliges an elected readout to change no token, per tap
//! rather than once for the election. The GGUF tap is watched clearing that
//! bar on the host backend, in `gguf.rs`, which reaches everything but the
//! one hazard the Spec names: installing the callback turns one graph
//! compute into a walk of windows, and a fusion candidate straddling a
//! window boundary goes unapplied, which is a device concern no host run
//! can reach. **The measurement on the real device pair was therefore owed
//! and is taken**, in `tests/readout_neutral.rs`, against the artifact this
//! workshop deploys: two seeds, each drawing a sequence identical with the
//! election on and off, the elected run folding one figure per layer per
//! forward. The deployed family declares its tap on that run, so the
//! election is one an operator in service can make.
//!
//! **A tap that fails while elected is a fault, not an absence.** Per charter
//! section 13.10: an elected observability that silently stopped observing is a
//! record that reads as a run without readout rather than a run whose readout
//! broke. [`TapOutcome`] carries no case for a quiet nothing, which is what
//! makes the distinction unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged.
