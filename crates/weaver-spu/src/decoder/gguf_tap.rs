//! conforms: spu-two-taps-one-shape
//! conforms: spu-tap-failure-is-a-fault
//!
//! The GGUF path's residual tap, per `weaver-spu-Spec` section 7.
//!
//! **This is the only unsafe surface the readout has.** The native tap reads
//! candle tensors through the fork's intermediates route and stays in safe
//! Rust throughout. The GGUF tap cannot: llama.cpp offers no route to a
//! layer's activations except the ggml scheduler's eval callback, which is a
//! C function pointer invoked from inside the graph walk, so the tap is a
//! trampoline over a pointer the caller hands back. Containing that in one
//! module is the point of the module.
//!
//! **What the tap matches, and why by name.** Every decoder-only body in the
//! fork ends its layer with `cb(cur, "l_out", il)`, which the context's own
//! naming callback formats as `l_out-<il>`. That is the post-residual-add
//! value the readout reduces, it is named identically across the hundred and
//! three bodies that carry it, and the bodies agree on nothing else, so the
//! name is a better handle than any position in the graph.
//!
//! **Three facts the mechanics turn on**, all read out of the fork rather
//! than assumed. The scheduler calls the callback twice per node, once
//! asking whether the data is wanted and once with the data standing, and
//! **a false answer on the second call abandons the rest of the graph**, so
//! this tap answers true there always and latches its faults instead. The
//! callback fires per **ubatch**, so a prefill longer than the micro-batch
//! crosses it several times and only the last of those carries the position
//! the decode asked logits for. And the final layer gathers its rows to the
//! output positions before the residual add, so the callback sees
//! `[n_embd, n_outputs]` there where the earlier layers give
//! `[n_embd, n_tokens]`: `ggml_get_rows` keeps `ne[0]` and replaces `ne[1]`,
//! so it is the column count that moves and not the width. The gather keeps
//! the batch order of the positions it retains, so the final column carries
//! the last position in both shapes, which is why the tap takes the last
//! column rather than a fixed index and needs no case for the final layer.
//!
//! **A ubatch is staged and committed rather than folded as it arrives.**
//! The figures for the ubatch in flight go to [`TapState::staging`], layer
//! zero clears it because layer zero is a new ubatch beginning, and the
//! decode commits what stands once the graph is done. The earlier ubatches
//! of a split prefill are therefore discarded rather than folded, which is
//! correct: their last column is the last position of a micro-batch and not
//! the position the generation is about to sample from.
//!
//! **A short observation is a fault rather than a short reduction.** Per
//! charter section 13.10, an elected observability that silently stopped
//! observing reads as a run without readout instead of a run whose readout
//! broke, so a commit whose staging does not hold one figure per layer
//! raises rather than folding what it has.
