//! conforms: spu-eval-callback-pinned-by-doctest
//!
//! The GGUF backend's residency half, per `weaver-spu-Spec` sections 3 and 4.1:
//! llama.cpp holds the model, the weights go to the binding's devices, and
//! dropping [`ResidentModel`] is what frees them. The decode half, the
//! [`crate::decoder::backend::Backend`] implementation over a llama.cpp
//! context, is the turn path's act and is not here.
//!
//! **The fork seam is a compile-time pin rather than a comment.** The fork
//! exists for one reason, the ggml scheduler's eval callback, which is the only
//! route to per-layer activations from a GGUF model without replacing the
//! engine, and the survey names this pin as the one thing standing between the
//! fork and a quiet loss. The doctest below calls the setter: it compiles
//! against the fork and fails to compile against the upstream crate, so
//! reverting the pin breaks the build rather than silently removing the
//! readout capability.
//!
//! ```
//! use llama_cpp_2::context::params::LlamaContextParams;
//! // The eval-callback seam: present in the fork, absent upstream. Reverting
//! // the pin makes this stop compiling, which is the pin firing. The callback
//! // is a real one and the assertion reads the state change, so the pin holds
//! // the seam open rather than only naming it.
//! unsafe extern "C" fn tap(
//!     _tensor: *mut llama_cpp_sys_2::ggml_tensor,

//!
//! **The two loader shapes the Spec names cannot reach this module.** The one
//! entry is [`ResidentModel::load`], which takes the admission's proof, so a
