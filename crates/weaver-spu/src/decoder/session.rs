//! The resident session and its append path, per `weaver-spu-Spec` sections 4.2
//! to 4.4.
//!
//! **Append-only, and nothing ever rewinds.** The session holds the resident
//! token sequence, per `weaver-spu-Spec` section 4.4 as of the cut act - the
//! re-establishing flush mechanism needs the tokens it re-decodes - and every
//! generation decodes only the delta at absolute positions from the sequence's
//! end forward. The archived tree's proof is the reason nothing rewinds: a
//! rewind fails silently on families that keep recurrent layers, because the
//! clear returns success while the recurrent state stays, and the failure
//! surfaces later as a position error far from its cause.
//!
//! **This crate calls no scoped-clear on a resident range**, which is the
//! discipline stated as an absence. There is no method here that clears a range,
//! and the pin below is that its absence is a compile error to depend on:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use weaver_spu::decoder::session::Session;
//! fn pin(session: &mut Session) {
//!     // No scoped clear exists on this type, and this is what says so. The
//!     // day someone adds one, this doctest starts compiling and the pin fires.
//!     session.clear_range(0, 5);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The behaviour and the surface are two records with two instruments: the
//! monotonic resident length is a perturbation test and the missing method is
//! this compile-fail pin. Neither claims the other's half, because a pin says a
//! rewind cannot be written and says nothing about a turn that re-prefills
//! through the append path instead.
