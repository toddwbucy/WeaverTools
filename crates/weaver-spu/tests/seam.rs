//! conforms: spu-out-of-order-refused-on-residency
//!
//! The lifecycle seam exercised against `weaver-harness-spu-contract`'s failure
//! cases, per gate H3: a contract that names a refusal and a build that cannot
//! produce it has not implemented the contract.
//!
//! These drive the real binary over a real socket pair, so what is exercised is
//! the envelope crossing the seam rather than a function called in-process. The
//! contract's ordering clauses are what they read:
//!
//! - admit is first and happens exactly once on a channel
//! - release is last, happens at most once, and is terminal
//! - a release with no completed admit before it is refused and is not queued
//! - a directive that arrives out of that order is refused and is not queued
//!
//! **The success path is not exercised here** because this file runs on every
//! build, and a build with no backend cannot admit. `tests/loaded.rs` carries
//! the admit-then-release round trip, and its coverage is conditional in a way
//! worth stating exactly: it runs on a build with the `cuda` and `gguf`
//! features, on a machine with a device and the model fixture, and anywhere
//! else it skips. A skip is a pass to the harness, so a green run of that file
//! on a fixture-less machine verifies nothing, and `WEAVER_TEST_GGUF` exists
//! precisely so a runner that means to exercise the load path fails rather
//! than skips when it cannot.
