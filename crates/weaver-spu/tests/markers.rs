//! conforms: spu-marker-promotion
//!
//! The inbound direction of `weaver-spu-Spec` section 5, bought as section 10
//! asks: every control marker a family renders tokenizes to exactly one token.
//!
//! **A marker that degrades to sub-word text is structure the model reads as
//! prose.** The renderer emits its markers as literal text, and that rendering
//! is faithful only where the tokenizer promotes each literal back to the one
//! control token it stands for. `str_to_token` calls `llama_tokenize` with
//! `parse_special` set, which promotes a literal **iff** the GGUF's tokenizer
//! marks that string special, so the property is a fact about the pairing of a
//! family's renderer with a family's tokenizer and not about either alone.
//!
//! **The load is vocab-only and reaches no device.** `with_vocab_only` reads
//! the header and the tokenizer and stops, so this needs the `gguf` feature and
//! no GPU, which is what the feature comment in `Cargo.toml` says that build
//! exists for. The archived tree's version of this test loaded full weights
//! onto `gpu_id: 0`; nothing here needs weights, and the salvage improves on
//! that rather than carrying it across.
//!
//! **Only the rendered set is asserted.** Promotion is the inbound claim, and a
//! family's parsed markers are matched as text against an emission this crate
//! never tokenizes. Where a parsed marker does not promote, the family module
//! says so at its declaration rather than this test asserting a property the
//! corpus does not claim.
//!
//! **The file also holds the flush declaration's check**, per Spec section 4.4,
//! because it is the other claim a family makes that only an artifact can
//! settle and the probe table is where the artifacts are named. Both tests ask
//! the same question in the same way: the family declares, the artifact
//! answers, and the two must agree.
