//! conforms: spu-two-taps-one-shape
//!
//! **Charter section 13.7's bar, taken as a measurement.** An elected
//! readout changes no token: the same declaration and the same seed produce
//! the same token sequence with the election on and off. The clause says
//! shown before a tap ships and shown per tap rather than once for the
//! election, so this is the GGUF tap's demonstration and it says nothing
//! about the native one.
//!
//! **Why this could not be argued from the source.** The tap installs an
//! eval callback on the ggml scheduler, which changes how the graph is
//! computed rather than only what is read from it: one compute over a split
//! becomes a walk of windows with a synchronize after each, and a fusion
//! candidate straddling a window boundary is not applied. A fused kernel and
//! its unfused equivalent are not guaranteed bit-identical in floating
//! point, and `l_out-<il>` sits next to a normalise that is a fusion
//! candidate. `weaver-spu-Spec` section 7 says so in as many words and calls
//! the tap plausibly observational rather than provably so. **This file is
//! where that plausibility is retired**, on the real artifact and a real
//! device, which is the only place the hazard exists.
//!
//! The host-side reading in `decoder/gguf.rs` covers everything but this: it
//! runs on a backend whose scheduler has one backend and no fusion to lose.
//! Both are kept, because a failure here and a pass there would localise the
//! defect to the device path immediately.
