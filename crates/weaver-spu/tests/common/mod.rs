//! The scaffolding the three integration suites share: the socket pair, the
//! descriptor placement, and the one-directive exchange. It lives once because
//! it existed three times, and the third copy had dropped the load-bearing
//! comment on why the lifted descriptors must be closed. A descriptor-protocol
//! fix applied to one copy and missed by the others is exactly the divergence a
//! shared module prevents.
//!
//! Each test binary compiles its own copy and uses its own subset, so the
//! unused-code lint is silenced here once rather than per-consumer: a helper
//! unused by one suite is not dead, it is another suite's.
