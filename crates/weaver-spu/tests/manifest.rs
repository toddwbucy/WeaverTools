//! conforms: spu-fixture-surface-pinned
//!
//! The fixture-surface assertion of `weaver-spu-Spec` section 1.2, checked the
//! way this workspace's other manifest tests check theirs: by reading the build
//! rather than by trusting a comment.
//!
//! **This crate had no manifest test until #288, and it is the crate with the
//! feature gates.** Every other crate in the workspace carries one. The absence
//! is why the Spec's table could have been written and then drifted with nobody
//! finding out.
//!
//! **What it pins and what it deliberately does not.** It pins that every
//! artifact variable a test target reads appears in the table, and that every
//! variable the table names is read by a target. It does not pin the vocabulary
//! roster: `markers.rs` asks each registry entry for its own artifact under
//! `WEAVER_VOCAB_<FAMILY>`, so the set grows with the registry and a fixed list
//! would be stale on the next family. The shape is checked instead.
