//! The Python connector at the dev boundary, per issue #134: the crossing
//! stays the one named function, seat and parsed request in, response
//! content out, and this module marshals it into an embedded interpreter.
//!
//! **The blade survives by construction.** Python reaches only what the
//! [`Seat`] proxy forwards, the proxy forwards only what the granted
//! `Ports` surface offers, and the seat cannot be minted from here any more
//! than from `dev_loop`. A stashed proxy dies with the call: the pointer is
//! guarded by a liveness flag cleared before the crossing returns, so a
//! Python loop that keeps `seat` around meets a refusal, not a dangling
//! borrow.
//!
//! **The loop file is read and compiled on every turn.** That is the whole
//! point: edit the file, and the next turn runs the edit. Iterate at
//! conversation speed, then freeze the loop into a Rust composition root
//! for deployment - iterate fast, then freeze.
