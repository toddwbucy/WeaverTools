//! The hub: loop 0, the channels and their custody, trace authorship, prompt
//! assembly's deterministic floor, and loop 1's seat.
//!
//! The doctests below are the compile-time instruments of
//! `weaver-harness-Spec` section 8.
//!
//! Descriptors are owned types end to end
//! (`harness-descriptors-owned-types`): a handle that escapes its owner is a
//! move the borrow checker sees, not an integer copied silently. `listen`
//! consumes the listener it is handed, so this compiles:
//!
//! ```
//! use weaver_harness::{
//!     AdoptionFault, CoordinationListener, Harness, OrganBinaries, OrganParameters,
//! };
//! fn shape(listener: CoordinationListener, organs: OrganBinaries) {
//!     let _served: Result<Harness, AdoptionFault> =
//!         Harness::listen(listener, organs, OrganParameters::default());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ...and reusing the moved descriptor does not:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use std::os::fd::{AsRawFd, OwnedFd};
//! use weaver_harness::{Harness, OrganBinaries};
//! fn f(end: OwnedFd, organs: OrganBinaries) {
//!     let _ = Harness::adopt(end, organs);
//!     let _ = end.as_raw_fd();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! One constructor (`harness-one-constructor`): the fields are private and no
//! second path exists, so a struct literal fails to compile.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! let _ = weaver_harness::Harness { coordination: todo!(), organs: todo!() };
//! ```
//!
//! No path-taking surface (`harness-path-shapes-pinned-by-doctest`): the three
//! named shapes each fail to compile where the channel takes owned
//! descriptors. The general prohibition stays review's - these three reach the
//! shapes they name and not the open set of every way a path becomes a call
//! argument.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use weaver_harness::{Harness, OrganBinaries};
//! let _ = Harness::adopt("/run/weaver/alpha/coordination.sock", OrganBinaries {
//!     spu: "/opt/weaver/bin/spu".into(), gate: "/opt/weaver/bin/gate".into(),
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use weaver_harness::{Harness, OrganBinaries};
//! let path = String::from("/run/weaver/alpha/coordination.sock");
//! let _ = Harness::adopt(path, OrganBinaries {
//!     spu: "/opt/weaver/bin/spu".into(), gate: "/opt/weaver/bin/gate".into(),
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! use weaver_harness::{Harness, OrganBinaries};
//! let _ = Harness::adopt(PathBuf::from("/run/weaver/alpha/coordination.sock"),
//!     OrganBinaries { spu: "/opt/weaver/bin/spu".into(), gate: "/opt/weaver/bin/gate".into() });
//! ```
//!
//! The outcome enum is exhaustive (`harness-outcome-two-cases`), so a third
//! case reaches every caller loudly:
//!
//! ```
//! use weaver_harness::Outcome;
//! fn name(outcome: Outcome) -> &'static str {
//!     match outcome {
//!         Outcome::Left => "left",
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A loop mints no port (`harness-loop-mints-no-port`): `Ports` has private
//! fields and no reachable constructor, so a builder's loop composes the
//! granted surface or does not compile.
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0624
//! // `grant` is crate-private (E0624), so a builder's loop cannot name it.
//! let _ = weaver_harness::Ports::grant;
//! ```
//!
//! The channel state's three positions and the floor's exhaustive wire enums
//! together make every out-of-order directive reach a match arm rather than a
//! flag check, which `serve` holds structurally.
