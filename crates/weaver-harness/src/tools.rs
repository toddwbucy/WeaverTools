//! conforms: harness-tool-result-granted-not-minted
//!
//! The granted tool result, per `weaver-harness-Spec` section 6 and the tool
//! workflow's opening act: the loop closes at the type level here.
//!
//! **The grant is constructed at exactly one site**, the completion of the
//! execution exchange of `weaver-harness-gate-contract` section 2, whichever
//! of the exchange's three contents arrived - the tool's result, the tool's
//! failure, or the gate's refusal of an unheld name - because each is a fact
//! the model must learn, and a refusal that could not author a tool-result
//! turn would leave the conversation with a hole where the answer goes.
//!
//! **Three negatives, each a compile property**, the `PeerIdentity` pattern
//! one seam over: the gate exchange supplies it and no code asserts it.
//!
//! No `Deserialize` (`harness-tool-result-granted-not-minted`): bytes never
//! mint a grant, on any seam, in any test.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn de<T: for<'de> serde::Deserialize<'de>>() {}
//! de::<weaver_harness::ToolResult>();
//! ```
//!
//! No public construction: the fields are private and the one constructor is
//! `pub(crate)`, so the struct literal below does not compile and no public
//! function returns one from anything a consumer can supply.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! let fake = weaver_harness::ToolResult { content: String::new() };
//! ```
//!
//! No conversion from the record: the conversation's `ToolResultBlock` is a
//! serde record that grants nothing, and no `From` bridges it back.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn from<T: From<weaver_traits::ToolResultBlock>>() {}
//! from::<weaver_harness::ToolResult>();
//! ```

/// How many execution rounds one turn may run before the harness stops
/// re-generating, the composition root's bound like `HEADROOM_BYTES`: a model
/// that answers every result with another call would otherwise hold the turn
/// open without limit. The bound is a refusal of further calls rather than of
/// the turn: the final generation's emission stands.
///
/// **Raised from four on 2026-08-20, against a task that measured it.** Four
/// was set where a round trip was a demonstration, and it stops a staged
/// task at its fourth step: a problem whose stages depend on each other -
/// an area, then the counts it divides into, then the prices those counts
/// carry, then the total - reaches the bound mid-derivation and the model
/// finishes from what it holds, which is where a model starts inventing
/// numbers. A bound that turns a tool user into a fabricator is measuring
/// the bound rather than the model. The number is what the ordinary
/// long-chain task needs with room over it, not a ceiling anyone should
/// reach.
///
/// **What it does not bound stays worth knowing.** A round is one
/// generation and its calls, so this counts sequential dependence and never
/// the calls inside one round: the emission of 2026-08-20 that carried
/// thirty-three identical calls spent one round for all of them and was
/// held by the turn's token cap instead. Against a runaway the real stops
/// are that cap and the session's capacity, this one guarding the shape
/// they do not, a model that answers every result with one more call.
